This file explorer will use c code and will run as a .txt file using dirent.h which supposedly comes standard for windows these days. We could also potentially achieve the same result using the c++ process api. 

Our file explorer should also have a user interface, which should be able to display an icon for each file when the directory is opened and it should close when the appropriate button is clicked. However if we are short on time we may scrap this idea in favor of text commands. In the event that we do use text commands, we will be using the same format as linux command prompt commands to ensure our own sanity. 

Some of the features we will be working with include creating new files, creating a folder, opening a file, running programs, and deleting files.
